<h1>h5mc</h1>


<hr><h2><code>h5new</code></h2>

Create a new HDF5 file called <code>new.h5</code> containing a sample group (<code>examples</code>) 
and dataset of doubles (<code>doubles</code>). 

<p>The file will not be overwritten if it already exists. An error will be generated. </p>


<hr><h2><code>h5rank</code></h2>

Creates a Greenblatt-esque score based on yield and gearing. I haven't properly verified it, but it looks like it is giving reasonable results.

<p>It relies on the cxxstats library that I have created. It shouldn't be a problem if you have done a <code>make install</code> on the library in question. </p>

<p>I grow weary of HDF5. h5rank does not use HDF5.</p>

<p>h5rank has hard-coded fields to extract. I could generalise it if I need it in future. It is important, though, because it decodes the StatsList.csv file.</p>

<hr><h2><code>shsl</code></h2>

sharelock holmes stats list

<p>Imports 
<code>/home/mcarter/.fortran/STATSLIST/StatsList.csv</code>
into file
<code>/home/mcarter/.fortran/sharelock.h5</code>
, giving it a datestamp corresponding to the creation date of the CSV file. 

The file should NOT be preprocessed beforehand. It is able to work out if the columns are strings or numerica data (string data always begins with a double-quote). </p>


<p>Prior to May 2016, processing was done using flex and bison. This has been eliminated, although source files are in the yacc directory at the top level. </p>

<p>There seems to a bug: you need to run <code>shsl</code> twice for the dataset to be written
