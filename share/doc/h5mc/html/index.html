sharelock holmes stats list

<p>Imports 
<code>/home/mcarter/.fortran/STATSLIST/StatsList.csv</code>
into file
<code>/home/mcarter/.fortran/sharelock.h5</code>
, giving it a datestamp corresponding to the creation date of the CSV file. 

The file should NOT be preprocessed beforehand. It is able to work out if the columns are strings or numerica data (string data always begins with a double-quote). </p>


<p>Prior to May 2016, processing was done using flex and bison. This has been eliminated, although source files are in the yacc directory at the top level. </p>
