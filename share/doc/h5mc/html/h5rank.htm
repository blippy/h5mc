<h1>h5mc</h1>

<hr><h2><code>h5rank</code></h2>

Creates a Greenblatt-esque score based on yield and gearing. I haven't properly verified it, but it looks like it is giving reasonable results.

<p>It relies on the cxxstats library that I have created. It shouldn't be a problem if you have done a <code>make install</code> on the library in question. </p>

<p>I grow weary of HDF5. h5rank does not use HDF5.</p>

<p>h5rank has hard-coded fields to extract. I could generalise it if I need it in future. It is important, though, because it decodes the StatsList.csv file.</p>
